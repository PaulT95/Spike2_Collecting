# Spike2_Collecting
Spike script for collecting and sampling with a nice interface

You can change the sequencer to create specific TTL and trigger the devices
You can create or import specific ramps to follow based on the feedback (in this case you can chose the channel)
You can save snippet single shot of (17s) where the TTL starts after 1s and finishes 1s earlier (15s) 
So many other functions are included, but can applied it as you prefer. 

PS: here the frequency is 2000Hz so the ramp are 30000points, or the calculation are based on that
