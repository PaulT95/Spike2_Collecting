# PATEC Script: Spike2 Data Collection

The PATEC script is a user-friendly Spike2 script designed for collecting and sampling data efficiently. This tool provides a customizable interface for diverse lab settings, making data acquisition straightforward and flexible.

## Overview
The primary functions and operational details of this script are described in the [ReadMe Word file](www.linktothefile.com) file. The script allows for real-time updates to the sequencer, enabling users to create specific TTL or DutyCycle signals to trigger devices as needed. Depending on your goals, the sequencer can adapt in real time with a fixed setup.

### Features
1. **Ramps and Traces with Real-Time Visual Feedback**:
**:
   - Users can create or import linear ramp directly in Spike2
   - Select a channel from the Sampling configuration for live feedback plotting.
   - Import non-linear or custom traces to plot and import from `.txt` files (formatted as two columns: X for time, and Y for the ramp/trace array). Examples available in MATLAB/Python for generating sinewave ramps are in the extra folder.
   - A hand-draw feature is included for creating custom paths with the mouse.
   - Users can visualize and follow real-time feedback and follow specific traces designed in the XY ramp.

2. **Snippet Functionality**:
   - Lunch the visual live feedback, while the sequencer does the hard work in the back ground. Extract then the data within a user-defined XY range (default: 15s) set in the XY-ramp settings.
   - The snippet exports all **RAW** channels as a `.MAT` file, capturing data from Cursor(0) to Cursor(0) + (X range * n repetition) + 1s. This includes one second before and after the defined range to ensure comprehensive data collection.

### Sequencer Details
The sequencer dynamically updates based on changes made in the "XY Rep / Seq Config" settings, eliminating the need for manual reprogramming. This:
   - Facilitates rapid testing and piloting across various conditions.
   - Supports repetitive ramp wtih cycle operations.

When repeating cycles, the XY view resets to 0 at the beginning of each cycle, avoiding continuous scrolling. This ensures smoother visualization and minimizes flickering, which can be visually distracting and hard to follow for participants. This also allows permanent vertical dashed lines in the plot, providing consistent visual reference points, regardless of the cycle.

## Auto-Saving Ultrasound Videos
For Telemed ultrasound video saving in `.tvd` format, you can use the accompanying executable console script. Refer to the [Save TVD](https://github.com/PaulT95/Save_TVD_exe) library for details. Additionally, commands to control EchoWave via Spike2 buttons can be implemented using the [EchoWave CMD](https://github.com/PaulT95/EchoWave_cmd) library.

## Example: Real-Time Visual Torque Feedback
Below is an example of real-time torque feedback on a linear ramp using GAME MODE. The dashed lines indicate the start and end points of the dynamometer rotation, triggered by DIGOUT set up automatically in the sequencer.
